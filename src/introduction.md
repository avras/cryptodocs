# Introduction

This is a collection of notes and links about cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. Until now, whenever someone asked me for references about these topics I would email them a bunch of annotated links. From now on, I hope to simply direct them to this collection of pages.

My name is **Saravanan Vijayakumaran**. I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering of IIT Bombay. More information about me is available [here](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~sarva).
